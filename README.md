# JStack Course

This repository contains the course folders for the JStack classes.
The course is focused on ReactJS, going through class components, state, props, and lifecycle methods.
Each component on the course is a separate folder, and folders ending in _\*-app_ contain the code for an application.

Each application has it's own README.md file, which contains the instructions for the application as well as the link for the live demo.

I'm documenting everything I learn on my public notion workspace, which can be accessed here:

## Course Folders

- **contacts-app**

  - This folder contains the code for MyContacts application. It's a simple application that allows you to add, edit, and delete contacts.

  - This folder contains a very simple application that served to learn about the initial setup of a React application. It's not hosted nor has a README.md file.
